# Capstone-Project-Medanta-Helathcare-Analytics-

You have been hired as Chief Data Scientist of Medanta Group – a not for profit organization dedicated in 
making health conditions for working professionals better. Medanta was started because the founders saw 
their family suffer due to bad work life balance and neglected health.

Medanta organizes health camps in several cities with low work life balance. They reach out to working 
people and ask them to register for these health camps. For those who attend, Medanta provides them 
facility to undergo health checks or increase awareness by visiting various stalls (depending on the format 
of camp).

Medanta has conducted 65 such events over a period of 4 years and they see a high drop off between 
“Registration” and Number of people taking tests at the Camps. In last 4 years, they have stored data of 
~110,000 registrations they have done.

One of the huge costs in arranging these camps is the amount of inventory you need to carry. If you carry 
more than required inventory, you incur unnecessarily high costs. On the other hand, if you carry less 
than required inventory for conducting these medical checks, people end up having bad experience

The Process:

Medanta employees / volunteers reach out to people and drive registrations. During the camp, People who 
“ShowUp” either undergo the medical tests or visit stalls depending on the format of health camp.

Other things to note:

Since this is a completely voluntary activity for the working professionals, Medanta usually has little profile 
information about these people. For a few camps, there was hardware failure, so some information about date 
and time of registration is lost. Medanta runs 3 formats of these camps. The first and second format provides 
people with an instantaneous health score. The third format provides information about several health issues 
through various awareness stalls
